In elementary school, I heard of an opportunity to learn how to program the Micro:Bit. The Micro:Bit is a small programable microprocessor that allows young students to gain first-hand experience with real-world programming. So, at the age of ten, I attended an afterschool workshop at a local school, hosted by UTD, which taught us how to write many programs such as temperature sensing, displaying images on the built-in LED Board, and even the radio transmission of information from one Micro:Bit to another. This was also the first time I was introduced to new programming languages such as JavaScript and Python.
